          <p>At the end of the Spring 2019 semester, I was given the chance to go on a trip with the Min H. Kao Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.</p>
          <p>This trip, dubbed the "Silicon Valley Experience," gave a group of students the opportunity to visit the San Francisco area and learn about several different companies operating there.</p>
          <p>I had a wonderful time with the group that went, and I learned a lot about the tech industry and the San Francisco area! Below are some of the highlights from the week.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">The view from Lombard Street was great!</span>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Silicon Valley Companies</h2>
          <p>A major part of the trip was visiting different companies in the area and learning about their operations and offerings. Ranging from startups to household names, I got to see many sides of the tech industry in Silicon Valley! Here are my experiences with each one:</p> 
          <ul>
            <li><b>Saildrone</b> is a startup company that designs and manufactures a fleet of solar and wind-powered drones. These drones can collect information about difficult-to-reach parts of the ocean. This data has amazing potential for a variety of efforts, and touring the manufacturing facility was really cool! <a href="https://www.saildrone.com/">Check out their website here!</a></li>
            <li><b>Trimble, Inc.</b> develops a wide variety of technology to assist with transportation, agriculture, construction, and more. We got to tour their offices and view some of the gear and technology they use to test their products. The tour culminated in a ride around the parking lot in a self-driving tractor!</li>
            <li><b>Lockheed Martin</b> gave us the opportunity to tour the facility where solar panel arrays are manufactured for spacecraft, which was incredible to see! The size of the products and the scale of the operation was seriously impressive. In addition, I got to participate in a conversation with some of the company’s engineers about what they do, which was very informative.</li>
            <li><b>Hewlett Packard, Inc.</b> is a household name for a wide variety of technology products. I was able to view some of the most recent products released by HP and learn about the history of the company. The highlight of the trip was a visit to the garage in Palo Alto that the company was born out of. This is truly where Silicon Valley began!</li>
            <li><b>Cisco Systems</b> welcomed us to their impressive office space, where we could interact with many of the company’s products and learn more about its mission. I enjoyed learning about the history of the company and its vision for the future.</li>
            <li><b>Pariveda Solutions</b> is a country-wide management-consulting firm that let us come into its San Francisco offices and chat with the managers and developers. I learned a lot about the business model of a consulting company, and decided it is an area I definitely could be interested in in the future!</li>
